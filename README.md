# N-Queens-Problem

This program calculates solutions ot the N-queens problem for several values and instances of N. The problem itself is a classic logic puzzle in which N number of queens are placed onto a chessboard the size of N rows by N columns. The goal is to find a proper placement for the queens on the board so that none of the queen are in danger of being attacked by another queen. In other words, each queen must be placed on the NxN board so that no queen shares the same horizontal row, vertical column, or diagonal row with eachother. An array of queens is used to store the valid positions for queens on the board. For instance, if queens[4] == 3, then that means there is a queen placed on 5th row in the 4th column (because array indexes start @ 0, the actual row and column is 1 value higher than the index and value of the array). There are two separate methods for finding the solution to the N-Queens problem, a bruteforce method and a backtracking method. However, they both share the boolean isValid function to check whether the position in the NxN array of the chessboard is a valid position to place a Queen in. It uses a nested for loop using integer variables i and j to iterate through the two-dimensional array representing the chessboard, plugging i and j into the queens array as index values in order to compare queen's positions with eachother. It first checks that i != j to avoid placing queens in the same row. It then checks that queens[i] != queens[j] to avoid placing queens in the same column. It then performs a check to verify that the queens are not in the same diagonal row as eachother. If it passess all checks, then the current position is a valid spot to place a queen and the queens integer array is updated. The bruteforce algorithm
